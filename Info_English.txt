Binary Creations 1.0.3
----------------------


A while ago I came to the conclusion, that I no longer could do what i wanted with my standard items in Windows (taskbar, Desktop, etc. ) 
As full-time programmer, I use lots of shortcuts to folders or files, and programs which I like to start directly, with little effort, and rapidly
I also like, that the links to those many programs are not always on the foreground or in the background, and I can them start with a minimum number of operations
After lots of experiments with "Side bar" programs, I came to the conclusion, that those "Side Bars" do not always satisfy

So, I started the project "StartPadding.

The intention was to make a program where the user himself, can manage links in a window that he can nest in the system tray 
(so this window does not always hold a prominent place on the foreground)

Shortly I could note already, that in the part, where the user can choose an image to link with a program, the standard images which I had foreseen,
 probably would not satisfy the user

The solution; give the user the possibility to add images to the standard images.

To avoid problems with saving these images, I disided not to save these images separately, but in 1 file


In the past I have been working lots of times with producing binary files with several file contents, or records, however,
i didn't have any experiance with adding or removing files from a binary file (with records this is rather simple)


After searching VB-code for it on the web , with little result , I've started with this project (binary Creations)


Hopefully this can be also at your service!


The intention of this program: Combining several files to 1 binary file
                               Reading the file contents in the binary file (number of files, file names, etc.…)
                               Unpack files from the binary file
                               Add files to the binary file
                               Remove files from the binary file


Only the binary files which are produced with this program (or similar with the same base), can be edited with this program

I'll be putting the project "Sartpadding" on this site later on
